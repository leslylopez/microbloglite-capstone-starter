## interesting piece of code I wrote
- In this project, there was a lot of room for design. I really enjoyed writing the CSS for all the pages. In particular, I liked how my profile page turned out because I learned how to add a profile picture in the form of a circle as we're used to seeing in other platfroms. Setting the border-radius: 50% and overflow: hidden makes the square a circle. It was also very interesting to experiment with the background colors of the page. I learned about gradients and experimented with different colors until I found what I liked.
